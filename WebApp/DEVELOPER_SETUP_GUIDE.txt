The webapp project counts on using full IIS that is part of an windows 10 & 8 operating systems.

This guide will give you some hints on how to setup the IIS to work with this project.

1 - install visual studio with web packages or install them via nuGet packager
2 - the visual studio needs to run under administrator rights
3 - you need to enable the IIS feature in your computer
4 - you need to setup the IIS so that it works with this project
5 - you need to set the proper permissions on directory of this project
6 - you can specify the working directory for temporary files (if you do not want/cannot have the default one) - default one is: "c:\webdir\webapp"

- type "windows + R"
- type "appwiz.cpl" into text box
- click on "turn windows features on or off"
- check the box: "Internet Information Services"
- expand the box with "Internet Information Services - World Wide Web Services - Application Development features" and make sure following boxes are checked: ".NET Extensibility 4.7"; "ASP.NET 4.7"; "WebSOcket Protocol"

	- "IP address" = "All Unassigned"
	- "Port" = "443"
	- "Host name" = ""
	- "SSL certificate" = "IIS Express Development Certificate"

#1) disabling the conflicting site
- go to the conflicting site in the "Sites" folder within the IIS manager and click on it
